# Lines #3.1
Let p be a vector and d a non-zero vector. Then

$$
q=p+td
$$

is the **vector equation** of a straight line L. Specifically, as the parameter t ranges over the real numbers, **q** ranges over the position vectors of all the points Q on the line L. The vector d is called the **direction vector** of the line

A line with vector equation

$$
\left[\begin{array}{c}
x_1 \\
x_2 \\
\vdots \\
x_n
\end{array}\right]=\left[\begin{array}{c}
p_1 \\
p_2 \\
\vdots \\
p_n
\end{array}\right]+t\left[\begin{array}{c}
d_1 \\
d_2 \\
\vdots \\
d_n
\end{array}\right]
$$

can also be written as a set of $n$ scalar equations:

$$
\begin{gathered}
x_1=p_1+t d_1, \\
x_2=p_2+t d_2, \\
\quad \vdots \\
x_n=p_n+t d_n,
\end{gathered}
$$


When written in this form, they are called the parametric equations of the line.

CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:8 (find_package):
  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "fmt" with any of
  the following names:

  Add the installation prefix of "fmt" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set "fmt_DIR"
  to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "fmt" provides a
  separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been installed.
